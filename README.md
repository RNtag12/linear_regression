## Linear Regression Implementation and Optimization
This project is a simple practice project whcih explains how to implement and optimize a Linear Regression model using Python. The project involves data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and performance evaluation to achieve an optimal model for predicting house prices.


## General Information
Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. One popular ML algorithm is Linear Regression, which is used for predicting continuous outcomes based on one or more independent variables.
Linear regression works by fitting a linear equation to the observed data, allowing us to understand the relationship between the dependent variable (e.g., house prices) and independent variables (e.g., area income, house age). It is widely used in various applications, including economics, real estate, and social sciences.
The official documentation for the Scikit-learn library, which we use in this project, can be found at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/.

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the implementation and optimization of a Linear Regression model using the Scikit-learn library in Python. The dataset used for this project contains information about house prices and various features. The data is preprocessed to ensure that all features are scaled properly. Visualization techniques are employed to understand the data distribution and relationships between features. The project aims to evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
### Features
- Data Loading and Preprocessing: Reading the dataset, handling missing values, and scaling features.
- Data Visualization: Using Seaborn to create pair plots and correlation heatmaps to visualize relationships between features and the target variable.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Implementing Linear Regression, training the model, and evaluating its performance using regression metrics.
- Coefficient Interpretation: Understanding how each feature influences the target variable.

## How It Works
Data Loading and Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and we examine its structure and summary statistics to understand its contents.
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('HousePrices.csv')
print(df.head())
print(df.info())
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations are created to explore relationships between features and the target variable (Price).

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.pairplot(df)
sns.displot(df['Price'])
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True)
```

## Feature Selection
We separate the features from the target variable:

```python
X = df[['Avg. Area Income', 'Avg. Area House Age', 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms', 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms', 'Area Population']]
y = df['Price']
``` 
Train-Test Split
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance:
python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.4, random_state=101)

Model Training
We create a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn's LinearRegression class and fit it to our training data:
python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

lm = LinearRegression()
lm.fit(X_train, y_train)

Model Evaluation
After training the model, we evaluate its performance by examining its coefficients and calculating various regression metrics:
python
# Coefficients
coeff_df = pd.DataFrame(lm.coef_, X.columns, columns=['Coefficient'])
print(coeff_df)

# Predictions
predictions = lm.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation Metrics
from sklearn import metrics

print('MAE:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions))
print('MSE:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
print('RMSE:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)))

Steps to Execute the Project
Clone the repository or download the script.
Install the required dependencies:
bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

Ensure the dataset is in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to the dataset, then run the script:
bash
python linear_regression_model.py

Conclusion
By implementing and optimizing a Linear Regression model, this project showcases the importance of data preprocessing and evaluation metrics in machine learning. The evaluation metrics help assess model accuracy effectively. This method can be applied to various datasets to achieve reliable predictions for continuous outcomes such as house prices.
